title: Was ist OpenIus?
---

The idea of OpenIus is to provide a **collection of legal document templates and examples** (such as contracts and letters of association etc.) accessible online on a single.

By relying on a crowd-controlled open source platform, it should become a kind of Wikipedia for legal document

For its technical implementation it relies on 3 main tools:

* The own [LexDown](/lexdown) file format for legal texts.
* Git version control for content management
* [github.com](www.github.com/OpenIus) for hosting and maintaining.
